# Overview
IssieSays is an application that serves as a voice output and allows you to quickly record a message and play it by clicking on the screen.

The application was developed especially for people with complex communication needs (CCN), who can use the application to express a quick and regular message or to share an experience.

The application was developed by the Beit Issie Shapiro Technology Center in collaboration with SAP Labs Israel and is part of a package of applications developed and adapted to the communicative, social and educational needs of children and adults with disabilities.

Special thanks to the volunteers at the SAP Labs Israel, who are attentive to every educational and therapeutic need that arises from the field and develop life-changing applications with us.
